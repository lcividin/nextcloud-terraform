ðŸ“¦ Set up NextCloud using Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is pretty rad, so is [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/). Let's use one to set up the other.

This set of Terraform files eases the process of getting your own Nextcloud instance running from the ground up. All you need is to have your local `awscli` set up and hit `terraform apply` to get to business.

__To do__

- [ ] Set up lambda to manager up/downtime
- [ ] Tidy up TF files
